# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`


# Goal of this project

With this project, I intend to build a web app similar to Kobold Fight Club where random monster encounters for DnD are generated depending on the specifications required by the DM creating them (size of monster, type, alignment, etc.).
